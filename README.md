This is a modification of pagedown, a converter and editor for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), to work with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/).

You can find the original pagedown sources at [https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/).

Some icons in the editor's toolbar are not part of Bootstrap, but I've found them in [another pagedown for Bootstrap fork](https://github.com/samwillis/pagedown-bootstrap) by Sam Willis. Unfortunately he has deleted his Github account in the meantime, so I can't ask for permissions.
